# Example Data

Here we provide example mouse data for users to explore *AutoGaitA*. Note that this dataset was used in our tutorial videos introducing *AutoGaitA_DLC*, *AutoGaitA_Group* and in our video explaining file preparation for *AutoGaitA_DLC*. 

It contains:
- **Example full dataset** (i.e., .csv and video files, Annotation Table, and Results folder) with DLC-tracked body and beam (i.e.) coordinates for mice walking on a 25mm wide beam.
- **Example *Results* folders** for mice walking on 25mm, 12mm, and 5mm wide beams (to be used with *AutoGaitA_Group*)
- **Example and Template** Annotation Table files to be used with *AutoGaitA_DLC* and *AutoGaitA_Simi*

## 25mm 
In this folder we provide example .csv coordinate files as well as corresponding videos of DLC-tracked mice. This dataset can be used with *AutoGaitA_DLC* to extract kinematic features. Users can either try to replicate the *Results* folder, generated with the default settings, or play around with custom joints/angles (e.g., trying to extract features of the forelimb). However, users are advised to use the *Results* folder as provided here if they'd like to perform a 3-group analyses using AutoGaitA_Group (see below).

## 12 & 5mm
In these folders we only provide the *Results* folder of mice walking over 12mm and 5mm wide beams (to limit this repository's overall size). The three *Results* folders can be used with *AutoGaitA_Group* to assess how our five example mice adapt to the beam-width perturbation. See our instructions tutorial for a walkthrough using this dataset.

## annotation tables
In this folder we provide example as well as template *Annotation Tables* for *AutoGaitA_DLC* as well as *AutoGaitA_Simi*. Users are strongly encouraged to use the templates we provide here for their data and after entering their timestamp information compare the formatting to our example tables.
