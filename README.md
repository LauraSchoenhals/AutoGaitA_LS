# Welcome to Automated Gait Analysis in Python üê∏

AutoGaitA simplifies, accelerates, and standardises gait analyses after body posture tracking with DeepLabCut and Simi Motion. AutoGaitA's first-level tools provide a wide range of automated kinematic analyses for each input video and AutoGaitA Group allows the comparison of up to six groups adopting Principal Component Analyses and statistical procedures. AutoGaitA enables comparisons to be made across experimental conditions, species, disease states or genotypes. Further, despite being developed with locomotion data, AutoGaitA can be utilised for the analysis of any motor behaviour.

## Getting Started

It is strongly recommended that create a separate virtual environment for AutoGaitA via:

`python -m venv env_gaita`

After creating and activating the virtual environment, AutoGaitA can be installed via pip:

`pip install autogaita`

And the main user interface can be evoked via:

`python -m autogaita`

For a detailed step-by-step walkthrough of how to set up the virtual environment in MacOS and Windows and install autogaita, see our [Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y4wrrsjs0ybLDKPzE2LAatqPDq9jtwjIuk4M0jRZ3wE/edit?usp=sharing)
