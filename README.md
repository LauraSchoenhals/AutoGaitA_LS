# Automated Gait Analysis in Python üê∏

- AutoGaitA simplifies, accelerates, and standardises gait analyses after body posture tracking with [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut) and [Simi Motion](http://www.simi.com/en/products/movement-analysis/simi-motion-2d3d.html?type=rss%2F). 
- AutoGaitA's first-level tools provide a wide range of automated kinematic analyses for each input video and AutoGaitA Group allows the comparison of up to six groups. 
- AutoGaitA enables comparisons to be made across experimental conditions, species, disease states or genotypes. 
- Despite being developed with gait data, AutoGaitA can be utilised for the analysis of any motor behaviour.

## Getting Started

*For a detailed step-by-step walkthrough of how to install autogaita, see our [Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y4wrrsjs0ybLDKPzE2LAatqPDq9jtwjIuk4M0jRZ3wE/edit?usp=sharing)*

It is strongly recommended that a separate virtual environment for AutoGaitA is created via

`python -m venv env_gaita`

After creating and activating the virtual environment, AutoGaitA can be installed via pip

`pip install autogaita`

The main user interface can then be accessed via

`python -m autogaita`
